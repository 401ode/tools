# Application Frameworks

By dominant language:

## Python

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Full featured Python-based framework. Batteries very muhc included. Instagram runs on it, for what that's worth.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Flexible micro-framework.
- [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) - Haven't used it yet, but it might thread the needle between Flask's minimalism and Django's "batteries included" framework approach.

## Elm

- [Elm Language Basic](https://www.elm-lang.org) - A very opinionated language that compiles to Javascript. And is faster and more reliable than Javascript.

## Javascript

Node sucks. I'm not even going to link to it.

- [DADI](http://beta.dadi.tech/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [REACT](https://reactjs.org/)

## PHP

- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - Really more of a proper CMS than an application framework, but still.
- [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/) - Also more of a CMS, but very powerful.
