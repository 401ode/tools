# Application Frameworks
By dominant language:

### Python

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Full featured Python-based framework.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Flexible micro-framework.
- [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) - Haven't used it yet, but it might thread the needle between Flask's minimalism and Django's "batteries included" framework approach. 


### Elm
- [Elm Language Basic](https://www.elm-lang.org)


### Javascript
Node sucks. I'm not even going to link to it.
- [DADI](http://beta.dadi.tech/)


### PHP
- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - Really more of a proper CMS than an application framework, but still.
