# Application Frameworks
By dominant language:

### Python

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Full featured Python-based framework.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Flexible micro-framework.

### Javascript
Node sucks. I'm not even going to link to it.
- [DADI](http://beta.dadi.tech/)

### PHP
- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) - Really more of a proper CMS than an application framework, but still.
