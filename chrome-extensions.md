# Google Chrome Extensions

First of all, if you don't have [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome), get it. Firefox is cool, too, but Chrome is still the gold standard web browser.

Starting with a general list of extensions and then we can categorize later.

## Extensions

- [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en) - Automatically suspends unused tabs to free up system resources.
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - From the Electronic Frontier Foundation, this will automatically try to go to the HTTPS version of a website instead of the HTTP, if it's a viable option.
- [OneTab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onetab/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall) - Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once. Can save 95%+ of your system memory.
- [Scraper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scraper/mbigbapnjcgaffohmbkdlecaccepngjd) - Scraper gets data out of web pages and into spreadsheets. Select a table on a webpage, right-click, and select "Scrape Similar."
- [Data-Miner](https://data-miner.io/) - Similar to the above, but maybe better.
- [Simple Scraper](https://simplescraper.io/) - Chrome extension that enables data extraction form websites
- [Terms of Service; Didn't Read](https://tosdr.org/) - Gives you a summary of how sketchy-or-not the Terms of Service are for a given site.

- [JSONView](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc) - If you're interacting with JSON, this is a great extension to prettify it/validate it.
- [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/related?hl=en) - Apparently the best ad-blocker there is.
- [Let's Get Colorblind](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lets-get-color-blind/bkdgdianpkfahpkmphgehigalpighjck) - "...uses an algorithm to map on-screen colors to what a user with colorblindness might see," according to [this medium post](https://medium.com/dataservicesblog/a-study-in-magenta-d6753560da2d).
