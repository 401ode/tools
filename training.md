- Rhode Island State LMS - Rhode Island has its own Learning Management System. @bobbymartin to provide more info here. 
- [Anki Flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) - Apparently the data on these are very persuasive in terms of retention. The whole software package is open-source and well-supported. Good for training yourself on whatever you'd otherwise use flashcards. 

TODO: Organization, add major paid sites.
