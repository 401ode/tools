# Design and Graphics

## Photo Editing / Painting

- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) - Open-source painting program. Pretty slick and developing a big following.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Or GNU Image Manipulation Program. Photoshop if it were designed by Linux engineers. Always been an ugly interface, but it has lots of power.
- See [Non-Data Python](non-data-python.md) for info on Pillow, a Python image manipulation library. Good stuff.

## Stock Photos

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - "Beautiful, free photos. Gifted by the worldâ€™s most generous community of photographers."

## Vector Graphics

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - Imagine Adobe Illustrator if it were designed by Linux engineers. Again, ugly interface, but plenty of power. 

## Prototyping

- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) - Finally available for all editions of Windows 10, this is pretty legit. I can't believe Adobe is giving it away for free.
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com) - Collaborative group design and brand editor.
- [MockFlow](https://mockflow.com) - Pretty easy to use wireframing/prototyping tool. Good if limited free plan (only 3 mockups allowed).
- [Overflow](https://overflow.io) - "User flows done right." [Here's an example.](https://overflow.io/s/9ST7SX/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - Doesn't have UI components built-in like MockFlow, but for making quick drawings, sharing them with team members, and having everything sync beautifully online/offline, it's really pretty good. 
- [Pencil Project](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) - Undergoing a major overhaul to make it a more modern system. Supposedly quite robust. 
- [Atomic](https://atomic.io)
- [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) - macOS digital desgin toolkit with a strong plugin community. Probably the most popular thing on here. 
- [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) - Collaboration tool between designers and developers to share designs, assets, and measurements.

Also of interest may be this [comparison from the Vox Product Team](https://product.voxmedia.com/2017/11/1/16562200/a-highly-subjective-guide-to-design-prototyping-tools) that's pretty useful.

## Flowcharts

- [Coggle](https://coggle.it/flowcharts) - An offshoot of a mindmapping tool, this is a well-designed, easy-to-use flowchart tool. Nice free plan: 3 private flowcharts, unlimited public ones.

## Video

- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) - To quote [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/22/davinci-resolve-15-free-hollywood-video-editor-review/), "DaVinci Resolve 15 is a free, Hollywood-grade video editor." Incredibly powerful stuff. I kinda can't believe how much is in the free version.
- [AutoEdit](http://www.autoedit.io/) - Interesting concept. This thing will automatically generate a transcript of your video, then allow you to make selections from the transcript. The selections you make can be exported to be stitched together into a proper video. Apparently cuts down the video editing process immensely.

## Stock Video

- [MixKit](https://mixkit.co) - Completely free stock videos, license free. They ask for attribution, if possible.

# Content Management Systems

- [Site Leaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) - Based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
