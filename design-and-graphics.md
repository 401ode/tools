# Design and Graphics

## Photo Editing / Painting

- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) - Open-source painting program. Pretty slick and developing a big following.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Or GNU Image Manipulation Program. Photoshop if it were designed by Linux engineers. Always been an ugly interface, but it has lots of power.
- See [Non-Data Python](non-data-python.md) for info on Pillow, a Python image manipulation library. Good stuff.


## Vector Graphics

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - Imagine Adobe Illustrator if it were designed by Linux engineers. Again, ugly interface, but plenty of power. 

## Prototyping

- [Atomic](https://atomic.io)
- [Comparison from the Vox Product Team](https://product.voxmedia.com/2017/11/1/16562200/a-highly-subjective-guide-to-design-prototyping-tools) that's pretty useful.

## Video

- [AutoEdit](http://www.autoedit.io/) - Interesting concept. This thing will automatically generate a transcript of your video, then allow you to make selections from the transcript. The selections you make can be exported to be stitched together into a proper video. Apparently cuts down the video editing process immensely.


# Content Management Systems

- [Site Leaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) - Based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
