# Design and Graphics

## Photo Editing / Painting

- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) - Open-source painting program. Pretty slick and developing a big following.
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) - Or GNU Image Manipulation Program. Photoshop if it were designed by Linux engineers. Always been an ugly interface, but it has lots of power.
- See [Non-Data Python](non-data-python.md) for info on Pillow, a Python image manipulation library. Good stuff.

## Stock Photos

- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - "Beautiful, free photos. Gifted by the worldâ€™s most generous community of photographers."

## Vector Graphics

- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) - Imagine Adobe Illustrator if it were designed by Linux engineers. Again, ugly interface, but plenty of power. 

## Prototyping

- [Atomic](https://atomic.io)
- [Comparison from the Vox Product Team](https://product.voxmedia.com/2017/11/1/16562200/a-highly-subjective-guide-to-design-prototyping-tools) that's pretty useful.

## Video

- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) - To quote [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/22/davinci-resolve-15-free-hollywood-video-editor-review/), "DaVinci Resolve 15 is a free, Hollywood-grade video editor." Incredibly powerful stuff. I kinda can't believe how much is in the free version.
- [AutoEdit](http://www.autoedit.io/) - Interesting concept. This thing will automatically generate a transcript of your video, then allow you to make selections from the transcript. The selections you make can be exported to be stitched together into a proper video. Apparently cuts down the video editing process immensely.
