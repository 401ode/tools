#  Development Tools

## Text Editors
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - For ODE's money, the best text editor in the world. 
- [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) - a HUGE ecosystem of plugins for Sublime Text.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - unbelievably, an OPEN-SOURCE MICROSOFT PRODUCT. Not surprisingly, it's therefore a Microsoft product that doesn't actually suck. Also a huge ecosystem of plugins for everything imaginable. 

## Specialty Tools

- [Expresso](http://www.ultrapico.com/) - We (maybe) all know that regular expressions are incredibly powerful and **fast** tools for finding things in text. They're also difficult to master. That's why Expresso is great, because it has a GUI to help you construct the right RegEx to filter/find exactly what you want. It's amazing that no other tool online or offline that I've found does this quite as well. It also has pre-built "formulas," like the RegEx for finding Zip Codes. `(?<Zip>\d{5})-(?<Sub>\d{4})`, turns out.
