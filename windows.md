# Windows Tools

## Applications

- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) - Windows command line installer leveraging [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/). Kind of a meta-application.
- [Windows PowerTools](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) - If you like to party like it's 1995, this is for you. Sign of the times that you had to purchase a CD of these back in the day, and now they're in GitHub.
- [Windows Subsystem for Linux (Installation Instructions)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) - A full, honest-to-god Ubuntu linux kernel and shell, but it works completely and (relatively) seamlessly with Windows. I'm extremely impressed, I have to say. N.B. - Unless you're on a version of Windows that no one in State government is on yet, you'll have to do the semi-manual/command line installation and not the Windows Store version of your chosen flavor of Linux. (I said Ubuntu before, but you have several options.) 

## Command Line - `cmd` and `Powershell`

- `set` - "Display, set, or remove CMD environment variables. Changes made with SET will remain only for the duration of the current CMD session." Useful for seeing system environment variables.
- `Get-ADUser` - Powershell command to get an Active Directory user. Requires [Active Directory module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/addsadministration/?view=win10-ps), which you can [download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=45520).
- `Get-ADComputer` - Powershell command to get an Active Directory Computer. Same requirements as `Get-ADUser`.
