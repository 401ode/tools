## Databases

## Active Directory

- [AD Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer) - An oldie but a goodie. It's a GUI for browsing AD Trees, objects, etc. Can be a godsend for making sense of an ugly forest structure.

## Error/Log Management

- [IBM QRadar](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/ibm-qradar-siem) - The State uses this. It sucks, but it's the only central log system we have, to the best of my (@bmcguirk) knowledge. By a total coincidence, it's made by IBM. I was shocked to learn that... Anyway, it calls itself a "Security Information and Event Management" or SIEM system. That's a bit rich but, I mean, you can technically send log files to it. So there's that.
