# Principles and Methodologies

### [Twelve-Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/)
- I. Codebase
    One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
    [Factor #1 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/codebase)
- II. Dependencies
    Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
    [Factor #2 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/dependencies)
- III. Config
    Store config in the environment
    [Factor #3 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/config)
- IV. Backing services
    Treat backing services as attached resources
    [Factor #4 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/backing-services)
- V. Build, release, run
    Strictly separate build and run stages
    [Factor #5 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/build-release-run)
- VI. Processes
    Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
    [Factor #6 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/processes)
- VII. Port binding
    Export services via port binding
    [Factor #7 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/port-binding)
- VIII. Concurrency
    Scale out via the process model
    [Factor #8 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/concurrency)
- IX. Disposability
    Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
    [Factor #9 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/disposability)
- X. Dev/prod parity
    Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
    [Factor #10 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)
- XI. Logs
    Treat logs as event streams
    [Factor #11 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/logs)
- XII. Admin processes
    Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
    [Factor #12 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/admin-processes)
