# Principles and Methodologies

## Project Management

### Agile

We could write a book. And many have. But in the meantime, know this: Agile is provably a better way to run proejcts, build software. 

TODO: Linkfest. Or a separate .md page just on Agile.



## Collaboration

### Brainstorming, Idea Generation

- [Liberating Structures](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/) - "a menu of thirty-three... Structures to replace or complement conventional practices. Liberating Structures used routinely make it possible to build the kind of organization that everybody wants. They are designed to include everyone in shaping next steps." Cool stuff. We should use this more often and in more contexts.


## Software Design

### [Twelve-Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/)
- I. Codebase
    One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
    [Factor #1 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/codebase)
- II. Dependencies
    Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
    [Factor #2 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/dependencies)
- III. Config
    Store config in the environment
    [Factor #3 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/config)
- IV. Backing services
    Treat backing services as attached resources
    [Factor #4 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/backing-services)
- V. Build, release, run
    Strictly separate build and run stages
    [Factor #5 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/build-release-run)
- VI. Processes
    Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
    [Factor #6 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/processes)
- VII. Port binding
    Export services via port binding
    [Factor #7 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/port-binding)
- VIII. Concurrency
    Scale out via the process model
    [Factor #8 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/concurrency)
- IX. Disposability
    Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
    [Factor #9 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/disposability)
- X. Dev/prod parity
    Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
    [Factor #10 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)
- XI. Logs
    Treat logs as event streams
    [Factor #11 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/logs)
- XII. Admin processes
    Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
    [Factor #12 - 12factor.net](https://12factor.net/admin-processes)
