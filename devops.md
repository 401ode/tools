# DevOps

## Containers

- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) - easy to spin up virtual machines, configurable via simple YAML files.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - THE base container technology. Easy to configure, stitch together, and lock down. Preferable these days to Vagrant.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - The industry-standard way to scale out and coordinate tons of Docker images working together. Kind of amazing, really.
- [Scotch Box](https://box.scotch.io/) - Pre-configured Vagrant box. Very nice - everything just spins up and works.

- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - SSH-based automation technology.
