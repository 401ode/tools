## Hacking / Penetration Testing

- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) - This is arguably the only tool you need in this category, as it has a curated, pre-configured collection of the absolute best tools in every category. Eventually, I'll put a descriptive list of all of those tools in here, but this is a tremendously powerful good start. 
- [Powershell Empire](http://www.powershellempire.com) - A scarily-powerful Linux Powershell (yes, you read that right) and Python (sadly 2.6/2.7) compendium of post-exploit tools. I.E. you already have a credential, what can you do with it now? 

## Password Managers

- [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com)
- [Firefox Lockbox](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/firefox-lockbox)
- [1Password](https://1password.com)
- [Passbolt](https://www.passbolt.com/) - Built for teams. Open source. Looks pretty solid.

## CTF

- [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) - A huge CTF game hosted by Carnegie-Mellon University.
