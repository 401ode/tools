# Data Tools

- [Transformy](https://www.transformy.io/#/)
- [Datazar](https://www.datazar.com)
- [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/) - Great data cleanup platform.
- [Diggernaut](https://www.diggernaut.com/) - Web scraping service.

# Data Mapping
- [YWorks](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed)
- [The Brain](http://www.thebrain.com/)
- [Orange]()

# Python-based Tools
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) - included with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution. Gold Standard for Data Analysis, Data Science.
- [Dask](https://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) - For when your Pandas DataFrames get too enormous for Pandas. 

# Optical Character Recognition
- [Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/176692)
- [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) - this is a !@#$$!@#$ and a half to get working, but it's incredibly powerful once you get it installed. Next time I'm going to try getting it working in a Docker container and forget about it.
- TODO - Links to PyOCR, other Python tesseract libraries.
- [OCRopus](https://github.com/tmbdev/ocropy)

# Visualization Tools

We'll be migrating in some from this [list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkDKbi144mrDl7NSPMTRKyjdX8qfiL8MSlUw2z_dEIE/edit?usp=drivesdk).

## Python DataViz Tools

- [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/) - The original behemoth of DataViz tools. 
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Makes opinionated decisions for you on MatPlotLib settings, makes the MatPlotLib API much easier to use. 
- [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) - For easy, interactive visualizations. Very cool. 


# ~~Robots~~ Machine Learning
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - When robots take over the world, this will be the core of their DNA. TensorFlow is the principal Google Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning library. They open-sourced it a few years ago. It's generally considered the most powerful in the world. There are APIs for Python and tons of other languages now.
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) - An overall neural network API, but basically it makes interacting with TensorFlow way easier. See this nice [DataCamp Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/deep-learning-python).
